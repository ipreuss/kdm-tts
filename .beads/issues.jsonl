Look up which resources they earned (basic + monster-specific)\n2. Manually search through the basic resource deck\n3. Manually search through the monster resource deck\n4. Draw the correct number of random cards from each\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Button Location\n- Far right of the Rules Navigation Board (row 2, same as Back/Prev/Next buttons)\n\n### Button Availability\n- Available from showdown start until cleanup phase\n- Hidden if monster has no resource rewards\n\n### Behavior\nWhen pressed:\n1. Determine active showdown (monster type + level)\n2. Look up resource rewards for that monster/level (from rulebook data)\n3. Draw random cards from the EXISTING decks on showdown board:\n   - Basic resource deck (number depends on monster/level)\n   - Monster-specific resource deck (number depends on monster/level)\n4. Spawn drawn cards to the left of the settlement board\n\n### Design Decision: Use Existing Decks\nResources MUST be drawn from the already-spawned decks on the showdown board, NOT from fresh decks from the archive. Reason: During the showdown, events may allow players to take resources early (e.g., trap cards). Those resources are no longer available as post-showdown rewards. Drawing from existing decks ensures we only give what's actually left.\n\n### Multiple Press Handling\n- First press: spawn resources immediately\n- Subsequent presses: show confirmation dialog warning that resources were already spawned\n\n### Data Requirements\n- Reward data per monster per level (from rulebook):\n  - Number of basic resources to draw\n  - Number of monster-specific resources to draw\n- Monster type + level determined by active showdown\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Button appears on far right of Rules Navigation Board when showdown starts\n- [ ] Button styled consistently with other Rules Navigation buttons (DARK_BROWN background, LIGHT_BROWN text)\n- [ ] Button hidden if monster has no resource rewards\n- [ ] Button spawns correct number of basic resources for current monster/level\n- [ ] Button spawns correct number of monster resources for current monster/level\n- [ ] **Resources drawn from EXISTING decks on showdown board** (not archive) - run \u003etestrewardsexisting\n- [ ] Resources spawn to designated area (left of settlement board)\n- [ ] Second press shows confirmation dialog before spawning again\n- [ ] Button hidden when showdown ends\n- [ ] Works for White Lion (at minimum for initial implementation)\n\n## TTS Test Commands\n\n- `\u003etestrewardsbutton` - Verify button appears on showdown start\n- `\u003etestrewardshidden` - Verify button hidden for monsters without resources\n- `\u003etestrewardsspawn` - Verify resource data integrity\n- `\u003etestrewardsexisting` - Verify draws from existing decks (not archive)","notes":"## Current State (2025-12-08)\n\n### What Works:\n- ✅ Button appears on far right of Rules Navigation Board (row 2)\n- ✅ Button styled consistently with other Rules buttons (DARK_BROWN/LIGHT_BROWN)\n- ✅ Button shows on showdown start, hides on showdown end\n- ✅ Button hidden for monsters without resources (e.g., Prologue)\n- ✅ Draws from EXISTING decks on showdown board (not archive)\n- ✅ Confirmation dialog on second press\n- ✅ Test command: \u003etestrewardsexisting verifies existing deck behavior\n\n### Known Issue:\n- ❌ Resources spawn ON the showdown board instead of LEFT of settlement board\n- LocationData[\"Resource Rewards\"] is set to x=-10, y=2, z=0 which should be left of settlement board\n- But cards still appear on showdown board - need to investigate why\n\n### Files Modified:\n- ResourceRewards.ttslua - Main module\n- LocationData.ttslua - Spawn location definition\n- TTSTests/ResourceRewardsTests.ttslua - TTS integration tests\n- ARCHITECTURE.md - Documentation\n\n### Next Steps:\n1.
